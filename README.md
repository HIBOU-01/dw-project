## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, organizations collect vast amounts of information from various sources. A data warehouse provides a centralized repository for integrated, historical data, enabling powerful analytical capabilities and informed decision-making. This project aims to demonstrate the principles and practices involved in building a robust data warehousing solution.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- **Data Source Identification**: Identifying relevant operational data sources.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Development**: Building processes to extract data, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into the data warehouse.
- **Data Model Design**: Designing a star schema or snowflake schema for optimal analytical performance.
- **Data Warehouse Implementation**: Creating the database schema and loading the transformed data.
- **Reporting and Analysis**: Developing reports and dashboards to derive insights from the data warehouse.

## Features

- Automated ETL pipelines.
- Scalable data model for analytical queries.
- Pre-built reports and dashboards (if applicable, specify the tool, e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
- Supports historical data analysis.

## Architecture

(Consider adding a simple diagram here later, perhaps linking to an image in the repo)

The architecture generally follows a typical data warehousing approach:

1.  **Source Systems**: Original transactional databases or external data files.
2.  **Staging Area**: Temporary storage for raw extracted data before transformation.
3.  **ETL Processes**: Scripts and tools to clean, transform, and load data.
4.  **Data Warehouse**: The central repository, typically a relational database, structured for analytical queries (e.g., star schema).
5.  **Reporting/BI Tools**: Applications used to visualize and analyze data from the data warehouse.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**: For ETL scripts.
* **SQL Database System**: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) to host the data warehouse.
* **SQL Client Tool**: (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench) for database interaction.
* **Git**: To clone the repository.
* (Optional) **BI Tool**: (e.g., Power BI Desktop, Tableau Public) if you plan to use pre-built dashboards or create your own.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://githucb.com/HIBOU-01/dw-project.git](https://githucb.com/HIBOU-01/dw-project.git)
    cd dw-project
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Database Setup**:
    * Create a new database for your data warehouse (e.g., `dw_project_db`).
    * Update the database connection details in `config.py` (or similar configuration file if present).

### Running the Project

1.  **Configure Database Connection**:
    Open `config.py` (or the relevant configuration file) and update the database credentials:

    ```python
    # Example for config.py
    DB_HOST = 'localhost'
    DB_PORT = '5432' # or '3306' for MySQL
    DB_NAME = 'dw_project_db'
    DB_USER = 'your_db_user'
    DB_PASSWORD = 'your_db_password'
    ```

2.  **Run ETL Process**:
    Execute the main ETL script to load data into the data warehouse.

    ```bash
    python etl_main.py # Or whatever your main ETL script is named
    ```

    * This script will typically:
        * Extract data from source systems.
        * Perform transformations (cleaning, aggregation, etc.).
        * Load the transformed data into the data warehouse tables.

## Usage

Once the ETL process is complete, you can:

* **Query the Data Warehouse**: Use your SQL client to run analytical queries on the data warehouse tables.
* **Develop Reports/Dashboards**: Connect your chosen BI tool to the data warehouse and create visualizations to analyze key metrics and trends.
* **Extend ETL**: Modify or add new ETL jobs to incorporate additional data sources or transformations.

## Data Sources

(Specify the types and nature of your data sources. For example:)

The project utilizes data from:

* **`sales_data.csv`**: Contains transactional sales records (e.g., `date`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`).
* **`customer_data.json`**: Provides customer information (e.g., `customer_id`, `name`, `region`).
* **`product_catalog.xlsx`**: Details about products (e.g., `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`).

*(If applicable, specify the location of these sample data files within the repository, e.g., in a `data/raw` folder.)*

## ETL Process

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is orchestrated by scripts located in the `etl/` directory.

1.  **Extract**: Data is extracted from source files (CSV, JSON, Excel) or directly from source databases.
2.  **Transform**:
    * Data cleaning: Handling missing values, inconsistencies.
    * Data type conversion.
    * Calculations: Deriving new metrics.
    * Aggregation: Summarizing data to the desired grain for the data warehouse.
    * Conforming dimensions: Ensuring consistent keys and attributes across different fact tables.
3.  **Load**: Transformed data is loaded into the dimension and fact tables of the data warehouse.

## Data Model

The data warehouse is designed using a **Star Schema** (or Snowflake Schema, if applicable).

* **Fact Tables**:
    * `FactSales`: Contains measures like `total_revenue`, `quantity_sold`, and foreign keys to dimension tables.
* **Dimension Tables**:
    * `DimDate`: `date_key`, `full_date`, `day_of_week`, `month`, `year`, `quarter`.
    * `DimCustomer`: `customer_key`, `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `region`.
    * `DimProduct`: `product_key`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`.
    * *(Add other relevant dimension tables)*

*(Consider including an ERD or a simple text-based representation of your schema here, or link to an image.)*

## Analysis and Reporting

(Describe what kind of analysis can be done and what tools are used)

The data warehouse enables various analytical insights, including:

* Sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
* Top-selling products and categories.
* Customer purchasing patterns by region.
* Performance of different sales channels.

Sample reports and dashboards are available in the `reports/` directory (if applicable, specify the file format, e.g., `sales_dashboard.pbix` for Power BI).

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: For ETL scripting.
* **SQL**: For database schema definition and querying.
* **PostgreSQL** (or your chosen RDBMS): As the data warehouse database.
* (Optional) **Pandas**: For data manipulation in Python.
* (Optional) **SQLAlchemy**: For database interaction in Python.
* (Optional) **Power BI / Tableau / Metabase**: For reporting and visualization.
